# FYP_implementation

This repository is all the work done solely by myself during my final year project. 

This Repository has 2 sections Player Data which stores info about Fantasy Premier League Data including Fixtures, Results and player Data. 

Android Application then also stores the android application that recommends Transfers to users. 

## Usage
We hope to have the android application in the google play store by the start of the next season. 
All player and Results data is welcome to be used without asking. Just fork the repository so I know who has acess to it.
